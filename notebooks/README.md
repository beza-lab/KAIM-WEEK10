Task 1
Task 1 focuses on defining the data analysis workflow and understanding the model and data. This involves planning the analysis steps needed to achieve the projectâ€™s objective and ensuring a clear understanding of the key concepts related to the project.

Defining the Data Analysis Workflow:
Clearly outline the steps and processes involved in analyzing the Brent oil prices data.
Ensure a comprehensive understanding of how the data is generated, sampled, and compiled.
Understand the model inputs, parameters, and outputs.
Identify and state any assumptions and limitations of the analysis.
Determine the main media channels and formats for communicating results to stakeholders.
Understanding the Model and Data:
Read the main references related to the project to grasp the key concepts and models being used.
Familiarize yourself with models suitable for time series analysis, such as ARIMA or GARCH, and how they relate to the Brent oil prices data.
Explain the purpose and application of these models in the context of analyzing price fluctuations.
Identify the processes that generate the data and how these are modelled by the chosen time series models.
Describe the expected outputs and limitations of the analysis, and how predictions are made.
