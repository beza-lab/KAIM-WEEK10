Task 1
Task 1 focuses on defining the data analysis workflow and understanding the model and data. This involves planning the analysis steps needed to achieve the project’s objective and ensuring a clear understanding of the key concepts related to the project.

Defining the Data Analysis Workflow:
Clearly outline the steps and processes involved in analyzing the Brent oil prices data.
Ensure a comprehensive understanding of how the data is generated, sampled, and compiled.
Understand the model inputs, parameters, and outputs.
Identify and state any assumptions and limitations of the analysis.
Determine the main media channels and formats for communicating results to stakeholders.
Understanding the Model and Data:
Read the main references related to the project to grasp the key concepts and models being used.
Familiarize yourself with models suitable for time series analysis, such as ARIMA or GARCH, and how they relate to the Brent oil prices data.
Explain the purpose and application of these models in the context of analyzing price fluctuations.
Identify the processes that generate the data and how these are modelled by the chosen time series models.
Describe the expected outputs and limitations of the analysis, and how predictions are made.

Task 2

Adapt the Knowledge from Task 1.1 to Analyze Brent Oil Prices:
Build on the foundational understanding of time series analysis developed in Task 1.1.
Apply this knowledge to analyze the historical Brent oil prices data.
Utilize Additional Statistical and Econometric Models as Needed to Refine the Analysis:
Explore advanced time series models such as VAR (Vector Autoregression) for multivariate time series analysis.
Consider regime-switching models like Markov-Switching ARIMA to capture different market conditions.
Implement machine learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for capturing complex patterns and dependencies in the data.
Explore Other Potential Factors Influencing Oil Prices:
Economic Indicators:
GDP (Gross Domestic Product): Analyze the correlation between GDP growth rates of major economies and oil prices.
Inflation Rates: Examine how inflation in key economies impacts oil demand and prices.
Unemployment Rates: Investigate the relationship between unemployment rates and oil consumption patterns.
Exchange Rates: Assess the effect of currency fluctuations, especially the USD, on oil prices.
Technological Changes:
Advancements in Extraction Technologies: Study the impact of technologies like hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and deep-sea drilling on oil supply.
Renewable Energy Developments: Analyze how growth in renewable energy sources affects oil demand and prices.
Efficiency Improvements: Evaluate how improvements in fuel efficiency and alternative energy usage influence oil consumption.
Political and Regulatory Factors:
Environmental Regulations: Investigate how stricter environmental regulations and carbon pricing affect oil production and prices.
Trade Policies: Study the impact of trade agreements, tariffs, and embargoes on oil markets.
Adapting the Model to a New Scenario:

Apply the Analysis Framework to Different Scenarios or Related Datasets:
Extend the analysis to other commodities or related markets, such as natural gas or coal.
Compare and contrast the factors influencing different energy markets.
Extend the Model to Incorporate New Variables or Data Sources:
Integrate additional data sources such as economic reports, technological advancements, and regulatory changes.
Include macroeconomic variables and indices to enhance the model’s predictive power.
Validate the Model’s Performance in Predicting Future Price Movements and Other Outcomes:
Backtest the model using historical data to assess its accuracy and robustness.
Conduct out-of-sample testing to validate the model’s predictive capabilities.
Use cross-validation techniques to ensure the model’s generalizability.
Suggested Approach:

Data Collection:
Gather comprehensive datasets on economic indicators, technological changes, and political factors.
Utilise reliable sources such as the World Bank, IMF, IEA, and industry reports.
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies appropriately.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Perform EDA to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
Use visualisations to gain insights into the interactions between different variables and oil prices.
Model Building:
Develop multiple models to capture different aspects of the data.
Use time series models, econometric models, and machine learning algorithms as appropriate.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the models using performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Compare the models to identify the best-performing ones.
Insight Generation:
Interpret the model outputs to generate actionable insights.
Provide clear recommendations based on the analysis results.

Task 3: Developing an Interactive Dashboard for Data Analysis Results

Build a Dashboard Application using Flask (backend) and React (frontend) to visualize the results of the analysis, helping stakeholders explore how various events affect Brent oil prices.

Key Components of the Dashboard:
Backend (Flask):
Develop APIs to serve data from the analysis results, making it accessible for the React frontend.
Handle requests for different datasets, model outputs, and performance metrics.
Integrate data sources for real-time updates (optional, if necessary).
Frontend (React):
Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface to display the analysis results.
Design interactive visualizations to show how different events correlate with changes in oil prices.
Include features like filters, date ranges, and comparisons, allowing users to explore data around specific events or time periods.
Ensure responsiveness for various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
React tools for charts(Recharts, React Chart.js 2, D3.js)
Key Features:
Present historical trends, forecasts, and correlations with events (e.g., political decisions, conflicts, economic sanctions).
Allow users to see how specific events influenced Brent oil prices, with features like "event highlight" to visualize spikes or drops in prices.
Enable users to filter data, select date ranges, and drill down into details for deeper insights.
Display key indicators like volatility, average price changes, and model accuracy metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
